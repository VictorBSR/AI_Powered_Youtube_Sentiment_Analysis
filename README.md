## The Problem
- Small business owners, startups, and marketing teams are eager to understand how their products or services are being received in the market
- They wish for insights into customer opinions and trends, particularly on platforms like YouTube, to gauge performance and evaluate marketing KPIs
- Whether it's tracking product popularity or identifying sentiment, these businesses rely on real-time feedback to make data-driven decisions!

## Project Overview
This project aims to help users discover and analyze customer sentiment from Youtube video comments by:
- Searching for a given term, for example a product name
- Presenting the resulting video list from the research, while labeling each title as relevant or not
- Each video will have their comments analyzed based on their content
- Using NLP and AI, each comments will be classified under specific sentiment categories (Positive, Negative or Neutral)
- Presenting the sentiment analysis results via word clouds and brief descriptions that highlight key insights from the data

## Steps
- **Search for an expression/name (YouTube API):**
    - The YouTube Data API is used to retrieve a list of videos related to the search term
    - Python‚Äôs requests library interact with the API and parse the video metadata for further analysis
    
- **Classify Relevant Videos (ChatGPT/LLM Classification):**
    - Each video returned from the search is filtered by relevance using an LLM
    - Python‚Äôs openai library interacts with the LLM, where the video title and description are sent to classify whether the video is relevant or not (using a custom prompt).
    
- **Pre-process Comments:**
    - Once relevant videos are selected, the project uses the YouTube API to retrieve comments from each video.
    - Text preprocessing steps like tokenization, removal of stop words, and basic cleaning are performed using libraries like nltk or spacy.

- **Classify Sentiment (ChatGPT/LLM Sentiment Analysis):**
    - Comments from each video are passed to the LLM, which classifies the overall sentiment of each one as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
    - This is accomplished by using the OpenAI library to communicate with the LLM, with a customizable prompt to reflect the video‚Äôs context.
    - Results are saved into a Pandas DataFrame for structured analysis.
    
- **Word Cloud Generation:**
    - The most frequent terms in positive and negative comments are visualized in a word cloud.
    - Python‚Äôs wordcloud library is used to create these visualizations, offering a quick overview of the most discussed terms.
    
- **Final Summary and Insights (Sentiment & Summary Generation):**
    - For each video, a brief summary is generated based on the most frequent sentiments and key opinions.
    - The LLM produces a concise description highlighting significant trends (e.g., ‚ÄúMost users love the product‚Äôs design but complain about its price‚Äù).
    - The overall sentiment rating is aggregated and visualized for user interpretation.

# Preparing Inputs<a class="anchor" id="second-bullet"></a>
The first step is to search for video results and classifying their relevance based on a search expression, like a product name.

### Imports


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import nltk
import emoji
import re
import requests
import os
from openai import OpenAI
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from unidecode import unidecode
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer 
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from wordcloud import WordCloud
from langdetect import detect, DetectorFactory
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
```


```python
# keys 
api_key = ''
openai_key = ''
```

### Loading API and testing retrieval
First we try to initialize the youtube API based on the official documentation and return all the comments from a video based on its ID


```python
def load_api(api_key):
    # Set up the API
    youtube = build('youtube', 'v3', developerKey=api_key)
    return youtube

# Fetch comments
youtube = load_api(api_key)
```


```python
# Example usage
video_id = 'i1GXJFH8xm4'

# make a request for the comment threads
comments = []
comments_request = youtube.commentThreads().list(
    part="snippet",
    videoId=video_id,
    maxResults=100
)
response = comments_request.execute()

# make a request for video info
video_request = youtube.videos().list(
        part="snippet",
        id=video_id
    )
video_response = video_request.execute()
```


```python
video_response
```

### Search for video results

After obtaining a good understanding on how the data from a video is returned from the API, now we create a function to search for multiple videos based on a search expression:


```python
def search_videos(search_query, api_key):
    max_results = 10  # Number of videos to retrieve
    API_KEY = api_key

    url = f"https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?part=snippet&maxResults={max_results}&q={search_query}&type=video&key={API_KEY}"

    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()

    # Extract video IDs and URLs
    video_data = []
    for item in data['items']:
        video_id = item['id']['videoId']
        video_title = item['snippet']['title']
        video_description = item['snippet']['description']
        video_url = f"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={video_id}"
        
        # append to the list
        video_data.append({
            'video_id': video_id,
            'video_title': video_title,
            'video_description': video_description,
            'video_url': video_url
        })
        
    return pd.DataFrame(video_data)
```


```python
# quick test
df_videos = search_videos("Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses", api_key)
display(df_videos)
```

### Evaluating relevance with AI

With the video list, maybe not all of them will contain relevant info or relevant comments for our purpose. We need a way to quickly determine which videos will be relevant or not to the analysis. For this, a LLM will be used, and for a matter of simplicity and cost at this moment OpenAI's API is a good choice, and GPT 3.5 should suffice.

This was thought more as an optional step in order to allow the user double check which videos are about to be analysed and make sure none of them are unrelated to the desired topic, avoiding contamination of the upcoming sentiment analysis.


```python
# function to classify video title as relevant or not for our search
def classify_video(search_query, df_videos, api_key):
    # prompt
    prompt_sistema = f"""You are a marketing analyst skilled in evaluating the relevance of videos for product or topic analysis.
    Given a video title and description, determine if the content is RELEVANT or NOT RELEVANT based on its value for marketing 
    insights, research purposes, or general audience interest. Consider aspects such as alignment with the search term or 
    expression, potential to engage or inform the target audience, and contribution to a comprehensive understanding of the 
    topic. Your goal is to help filtering those videos so stakeholders can understand how their products or services are being 
    received in the market. You will receive a "search_string" for a product or topic that will be researched, as well as a 
    video title and its description. You should analyze each one of them and return only a single string with one of the options:
    ["RELEVANT","NOT RELEVANT"]
    """
    # initialize client
    cliente = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)
    
    # iterate every dataframe row
    for _,item in df_videos.iterrows():
        prompt_user = f"Search query: {search_query}\nVideo title: {item['video_title']}\nVideo description: {item['video_description']}"

        response = cliente.chat.completions.create(
            messages = [
                {
                    "role":"system",
                    "content":prompt_sistema
                },
                {
                    "role":"user",
                    "content":prompt_user
                }
            ],
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            max_tokens=10
        )

        result = response.choices[0].message.content
        df_videos['relevance'] = result
        
        
    return df_videos

### Adding more videos

We also want the user to add new video URLs aside from those if they want to, so we make another function for that:


```python
def add_videos(video_url, df_videos, api_key):
    API_KEY = api_key
    
     # extract the video ID from the URL
    video_id = video_url.split('v=')[-1] 
    
    url = f"https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?id={video_id}&part=snippet&key={API_KEY}"

    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    
    # Extract the necessary details
    video_title = data['items'][0]['snippet']['title']
    video_description = data['items'][0]['snippet']['description']
    
    # Append the new video information to the DataFrame
    new_row = {
        'video_id': video_id,
        'video_title': video_title,
        'video_description': video_description,
        'video_url': video_url
    }
    new_df = pd.DataFrame([new_row])
    df_videos = pd.concat([df_videos, new_df], axis=0, ignore_index=True)

    return df_videos
```


```python
# Testing everything together

# search for a product
search_query = "nike air review"
df_videos = search_videos(search_query, api_key)
display(df_videos)

# evaluate relevance
df_videos = classify_video(search_query, df_videos, openai_key)

# Pre-processing Comments<a class="anchor" id="third-bullet"></a>

In this step, I made a function that reads comments from a video and save them as a list of dicts:


```python
def get_comments(video_id):
    request = youtube.commentThreads().list(
        part="snippet",
        videoId=video_id,
        maxResults=100000
    )
    response = request.execute()

    # creating a list
    comments = []
    for item in response['items']:
        comment = {} # and a dict to store the results
        comment['video_id'] = item['snippet']['videoId']
        comment['channel_id'] = item['snippet']['channelId']
        comment['author_name'] = item['snippet']['topLevelComment']['snippet']['authorDisplayName']
        comment['author_channel_id'] = item['snippet']['topLevelComment']['snippet']['authorChannelId']['value']
        comment['like_count'] = item['snippet']['topLevelComment']['snippet']['likeCount']
        comment['total_reply_count'] = item['snippet']['totalReplyCount']
        comment['published'] = item['snippet']['topLevelComment']['snippet']['publishedAt']
        comment['updated'] = item['snippet']['topLevelComment']['snippet']['updatedAt']
        comment['text_display'] = item['snippet']['topLevelComment']['snippet']['textDisplay']
        comment['is_op'] = 1 if comment['author_channel_id']==comment['channel_id'] else 0
        comments.append(comment)

    return comments
```


```python
# testing the function
video_id = '0hwCp1TSHAQ'
get_comments(video_id)[1]
```




    {'video_id': '0hwCp1TSHAQ',
     'channel_id': 'UCw0leRmeaX7R_9BDd3TvCzg',
     'author_name': '@procuradehorizontes',
     'author_channel_id': 'UCAqFlxxVe6EvYloBZYOMU1Q',
     'like_count': 0,
     'total_reply_count': 0,
     'published': '2024-10-05T21:42:00Z',
     'updated': '2024-10-05T21:42:00Z',
     'text_display': 'cara, muito obrigado. Muito f√°cil e simples.',
     'is_op': 0}



Now, we should decide which data fields we are going to work with. In principle, considering our main goals, the following fields seems to be enough:
- **ID:** video ID
- **Channel ID:** useful to compare with the 'Author Channel ID'
- **Author name:** can be used as an identifyer for each user, as well as the 'Author Channel ID'. One of them might be discarded later
- **Author channel ID:** can also be used as an unique user identifyer
- **Like count:** useful to map which comments are the most relevant or popular
- **Reply count:** also can be used to measure the comment's level of popularity
- **Published:** can be used to perform an analysis of comment publishing over time
- **Updated:** can be used as a real timestamp for the comment's content. For instance if a comment is originally negative and then the user changes it's content drastically, the code will read and consider the new content along with this new date, instead of the original published date.
- **Text Display:** the main content, which will be the scope of our analysis

The Channel ID refers to the uploader's channel, and the Author Channel ID is from the user that made the comment. So if they are the same, it means the comment is from the uploader/owner of the video. This might be useful if we want to consider them into our analysis or not!

In order for us to build and test our NLP pre-processing pipeline, let's use the previously obtained dataframe 'df_videos'


```python
# obtain comments for each of the videos and save in a dataframe
def get_video_comments(df_videos):
    all_video_details = []

    for index, row in df_videos.iterrows():
        video_id = row['video_id']
        video_relevance = row['relevance']
        
        if video_relevance != "NOT RELEVANT":
            comments = get_comments(video_id)

            # append the video's details along with comments to the list
            for comment in comments:
                all_video_details.append({
                    'video_id': row['video_id'],
                    'video_title': row['video_title'],
                    'video_description': row['video_description'],
                    'video_relevance': video_relevance,
                    'text_display': comment['text_display'],
                    'channel_id': comment['channel_id'],
                    'author_name': comment['author_name'],
                    'author_channel_id': comment['author_channel_id'],
                    'like_count': comment['like_count'],
                    'total_reply_count': comment['total_reply_count'],
                    'published': comment['published'],
                    'updated': comment['updated'],
                    'published': comment['published'],
                    'is_op': comment['is_op']
                })
                
    df_videos_comments = pd.DataFrame(all_video_details)
    
    return df_videos_comments

df_videos_comments = get_video_comments(df_videos)

```


```python
df_videos_comments

Now the **text_display** column contains all our data to be analyzed, but in order for a wordcloud to be created from them, this data shall be pre-processed so the comments are clean and in a format that is easier to be used by models and other functions.

First, in our pre-processing, we shall determine what actions should be done and in which order to obtain the best results.

From previous experiences in other projects, in this pre-processing pipeline the following steps should make the most sense:
- Remove numbers
- Remove mentions (contains @)
- Remove links
- Demojize (convert emoji into words with their meaning)
- Standardization of the most common keyboard emoticons
- Remove special characters
- Convert all text to lowercase
- Standardize common slangs/expressions
- Removal of characters that repeat 3 or more times within a single comment
- Tokenize (splitting the string into tokens - the smallest string blocks that can be considered)
- Stopwords removal
- Lemmatization (convert words into their "root" form - variations of the same are grouped up)

We shall import the 'nltk' (Natural Language Toolkit) lib, which includes tools for text processing, classification, tokenization, stemming, and much more... as well as 'emoji' lib, 're' (regex), and 'unidecode' to treat accentuation.


```python
#nltk.download('stopwords')
#nltk.download('punkt_tab')
#nltk.download('wordnet')
```


```python
# stopwords are a pre-defined collection of words that generally don't add any significant semantic meaning to text,
# so it's a common practice to remove them

stopwords = nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english')
stopwords = list(set([unidecode(word) for word in stopwords])) # remove accentuation

lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

print(stopwords)
```

    ["didn't", 'for', 'having', 'couldn', 'these', 'if', 'under', 'own', 'very', 'i', 'have', "you'll", 'into', 'shouldn', 'until', 'most', "that'll", 'or', 'about', "it's", 'are', 'all', 'of', 'few', "haven't", 'it', "she's", 'your', 'too', 'by', 'each', 'aren', 'against', 'that', 'hers', 'shan', "don't", 'above', 'on', 'themselves', 'mightn', 'a', "needn't", 'once', "weren't", 'itself', 'our', "you're", "shan't", 'be', 'through', 'he', 'some', "hasn't", 'then', "hadn't", 'when', 'weren', 'them', 'than', 'won', 'same', 'did', 'was', "shouldn't", 'there', 'we', "mustn't", 'down', 'only', 'where', "couldn't", 'him', 'between', 'yours', 'me', 'out', 'himself', 'whom', 'should', 'with', 'haven', 'but', 'they', 'is', 'the', 'as', 'such', 'being', 'here', 'ain', 'yourselves', 'after', 'more', 'my', 've', 'no', 'so', 're', 'isn', 'do', "aren't", 'because', 'were', 'doing', 'ma', 'her', 'what', 'yourself', 'while', 'further', 'nor', "won't", 'before', 'o', "wasn't", 'hasn', 'doesn', 'needn', 'and', 'his', 'mustn', 'other', 'their', 'below', 'm', "you'd", 'an', 'those', 'will', 'over', 'to', 'who', 'am', "should've", 'any', 'can', 'you', 'not', 'why', 'from', 's', 'now', 'd', 'just', 'ours', 'off', 'has', 'had', 'y', "mightn't", 'wouldn', 'again', 'during', 'hadn', "doesn't", "wouldn't", 'ourselves', 'wasn', 'which', 'she', 'theirs', 'its', 'at', 'didn', "isn't", 'don', "you've", 'herself', 'this', 'myself', 'been', 'how', 'up', 'both', 't', 'll', 'in', 'does']
    

After some testing with the code below, I noticed two things: first, that there are some candidates for stopwords that weren't considered in the original list but they could be included. Second, some comments are in different languages other than English, and that surely needs to be dealt with in order for our pre-processing pipeline and LLM mdoel to work properly.

So we shall use another lib to identify the language, and only English will be considered at this time because otherwise we would need to build a separate pre-processing pipeline for each language. And since we don't know how many different ones we could find, this would be a project enhancement to be considered in the future.


```python
# Declaring a seed
DetectorFactory.seed = 42

# Function to detect the language
def detect_language(text):
    try:
        return detect(text)
    except:
        return 'unknown'
```


```python
# applying language detection to each comment
df_videos_comments['language'] = df_videos_comments['text_display'].apply(detect_language)
```


```python
# many languages were detected
df_videos_comments['language'].unique()
```




    array(['en', 'de', 'tl', 'sl', 'pl', 'so', 'fr', 'ko', 'et', 'af', 'no',
           'fi', 'sw', 'ro', 'id', 'unknown', 'nl', 'it', 'ne', 'lt', 'tr',
           'es', 'pt', 'cy', 'da', 'ca', 'hr', 'ru', 'hu', 'sk', 'sv', 'lv',
           'bg', 'zh-tw', 'zh-cn'], dtype=object)




```python
# checking percentage of comments in english
len(df_videos_comments[df_videos_comments['language']=='en']) / len(df_videos_comments)
```




    0.850104821802935




```python
# only consider english comments
df = df_videos_comments[df_videos_comments['language'] == 'en']
```


```python
# adding more stopwords found after some testing
stopwords.extend(['href', 'quot', 'br', 'u', 'r', 'lt', 'b'])
stopwords = list(set([unidecode(word) for word in stopwords]))
#print(stopwords)
```

### Wordclouds
Wordclouds are a fantastic way to display which words are most common in a given corpus, and they also work to express the big picture or a common opinion on a topic.


```python
vocabulary_pos = pd.DataFrame(np.concatenate(df['text_filtered'].values), columns=['words'])

# Generate wordcloud
wordcloud = (WordCloud(width = 3000,
                      height = 2000,
                      random_state=42,
                      background_color='white',
                      colormap='Set2',
                      collocations=False)
            .generate_from_frequencies(
                vocabulary_pos.groupby('words').size().sort_values(ascending=False).to_dict()
              )
            )
# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(40, 30))
plt.imshow(wordcloud) 
plt.axis("off");

# Classifying Sentiment<a class="anchor" id="fourth-bullet"></a>

In this step generally we could train a traditional Machine Learning model to tag each comment as "positive", "negative" or "neutral" based on their sentiment, but we don't have a previously treated dataset and most importantly we don't have a labeled target (needed in order to train a supervised model). One of the biggest advantages of LLMs such as OpenAI's ChatGPT is the ability to understand and classify text without a training dataset. That's why I opted to apply a LLM directly to classify the comments.


```python
# function to classify comment sentiments and create a summarization for each video
def analyze_comments(search_query, video_title, comments, api_key):
    # prompts
    prompt_sistema = f"""You are a marketing agent specialized in determining whether a video comments' content has a POSITIVE,
    a NEUTRAL or a NEGATIVE sentiment regarding the subject "{search_query}". After reading all comments, you shall return one
    of the three sentiments: ["POSITIVE", "NEGATIVE", "NEUTRAL"]. Additionally, summarize (max. 5 rows) the most frequent 
    positive and negative aspects and hightlighted features about the subject if applicable and if there are enough comments
    to reinforce those opinions (more than 2 comments). As for the output format to compose your answer, write only the sentiment
    word, a colon, and then the summary text.    
    """
    
    prompt_user=f"Video Title: {video_title}\n"
    for comment in comments:
        prompt_user += f"- {comment}\n"
        
    #print(prompt_sistema)
    #print(prompt_user)

    # initialize client
    cliente = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)
    
    # build response
    response = cliente.chat.completions.create(
        messages = [
            {
                "role":"system",
                "content":prompt_sistema
            },
            {
                "role":"user",
                "content":prompt_user
            }
        ],
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        max_tokens=4096
    )

    result = response.choices[0].message.content
    return result
```


```python
for video_id in df['video_id'].unique():
    video_title = df[df['video_id']==video_id]['video_title'].values[0]
    comments = df[df['video_id']==video_id]['text_display'].tolist()
    result = analyze_comments(search_query, video_title, comments, openai_key)
    df_videos.loc[df_videos['video_id'] == video_id, 'sentiment'] = result.split(':', 1)[0].strip()
    df_videos.loc[df_videos['video_id'] == video_id, 'summary'] = result.split(':', 1)[1].strip()

    OVERALL SENTIMENT: NEGATIVE
    
    Summary:
    The majority of comments regarding the Nike Air review express dissatisfaction with the comfort and durability of the shoes. Users highlight issues such as poor durability, discomfort, tight fit, heel drop design, and lack of cushioning. Price is also a negative aspect, with comments mentioning the inability to afford the shoes and labeling them as a rip off. Some positive aspects include appreciation for the style and looks of the Nike Air shoes, as well as the relief from foot pain they provide for some users. However, the overall sentiment remains negative due to the prevalent criticism of the comfort and durability issues.

    Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Review
    
    The comments always look different depending on what Game the ‚Äúfans‚Äù decide to D-Ride
    
    Nice. Dlc. <br><br>Time for Demons Souls 2 <br><br>Add flying <br>Beautiful open world <br>Zelda ish <br><br>Another game of the year for from software <br><br>Make it happen.
    
    Big DLC and you totally get your money‚Äôs worth for it, but a 9 not a 10 for me. Bloodborne‚Äôs The Old Hunters is still king of all DLCs IMO. The time travel, weapons, and unbelievable bosses in that one prove that quality wins over quantity any day.
    
    24902 Margaret Junction
    
    252 Rice Islands
    
    Me who still doesn&#39;t have the dlc and the whole game because of financial trouble üò¢
    
    Should you get the original one or the DLC?
    
    I&#39;ve never played elden ring. What are some tips? Starting tonight
    
    It‚Äôs great that elder ring is finally over it‚Äôs time for get excited for the next game
    
    This dlc is so big it could be its own game
    
    Goty 2024 is a dlc
    
    &quot;Never got lost&quot;...definitely not the case for me.  Most of my time has been spent trying to figure out where to go.  Not a knock against the DLC, though.
    
    For $40 and the amount of content and quality you get ... its basically free! Content easily worth  $60 to $70 barely $80 easy ..stretching almost $90 but no more! üòÆ and no less for $40 + tax
    
    Chuck Norris plays this game (and all DLCs)
    
    Masterpiece of all masterpiece kneel in front of him! or be dellu and dont accept the true perfection,its your choiseüòÅ
    
    Get out of your mom&#39;s or sister&#39;s basements ffs. You adults now. üòÇ
    
    15 years later and developers are still copying dragon age origins.
    
    Cfb 25 clears easy
    
    Elden ring is a turd wrapped in gold leaf. It has the most clunky, clumsy, outdated controls in a game I‚Äôve ever played. Until the nerds, who enjoy 80‚Äôs game mechanics, stop buying this crap, Fromsoftware will keep making it. One day we might get a great  game with modern day controls, a game that could truly be called a masterpiece.
    
    What the hell you spoil so many bloody bosses what the hell first time watching the review after smashing the DLC and thought I‚Äôll see what they said and you spoil so many thing in the game Jesus Christ.
    
    10/10 lmao, IGN ratings are completely meaningless. This is not a 10/10 DLC by any stretch of the imagination
    
    Im giving this dlc a 5/10 for map design and great rune ruining all quest progress otherwise solid lore but so many empty areas the abyss and frenzy was so boring
    
    Have they finally solved the infinite spawn bug?
    
    Why is he pronouncing it &quot;aired tree?&quot;
    
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2tj-b3DfmI&amp;t=330">5:30</a> Literally swinging a weapon without having the stat requirements‚Ä¶ These are the people they trust to give reviews‚Ä¶ üßê
    
    Are the new areas in the Shadow Realm visually striking? How does the level design compare to the Lands Between?
    
    ER is a 7 at most (open world ruins the pacing, the legacy dungeons are great tho) and the DLC is an 8 at best. IGN too scared to give it what it deserves because of the backlash
    
    IGN added 1+0 together and gave it a ten.
    
    The perfect DLC dont exist.... <br><br>- THE DLC: -
    
    Zero innovation in almost 15 years.
    
    Fort, Night!
    
    It&#39;s a great game but it&#39;s too hard. 4/10
    
    Lol oy 40 bosses for Elden Ring would be mini
    
    Gave up on the base game since they did the nerfs. Never giving them a cent ever. Keep nerfing!
    
    Sounds like an expansion to me‚Ä¶.
    
    Only one minor issue for me- no trophies/achievements. Not a deal breaker, just very disappointing.
    
    The special FX artist who work on this game is amazing!!!
    
    It truly is the ULTIMATE dark fantasy open world game....since it&#39;s initial release nothing hasn&#39;t topped it.üòä
    
    there are games from 1 to 10, and then there are games Fromsoftware xD
    
    Total rubbish. Games don&#39;t come any worse than this.
    
    Serious question: does ng+ affect the dlc? Because I&#39;ve seen people on ng+1 and are breezing past radahn, I&#39;m on ng+12 and can&#39;t even kill him.
    
    &quot;great variety in areas&quot; shows a tibia mariner
    
    Is it sill clunky lol. You know, a game entirely based on gameplay with clunky gameplay that NOONE acknowledges. Not weird at all
    
    how can a bad graphics like this get 10/10 . this game should get only 7/10.
    
    most overrated game of all time along with zelda
    
    Improving a masterpiece is no small feat
    
    They rated it Elden Ring out of Elden RIng. You&#39;re welcome.
    
    I&#39;m just glad IGN hired someone that can actually play a video game.
    
    This&#39;s why ign review is a jokeüòÖ
    
    Such disappointing DLC.<br><br>&quot;Raise the bar.&quot; The bar stayed where it was which wasn&#39;t very high and bold from FS to begin with.<br><br>&quot;But it never crosses the threshold into unfair.&quot;<br><br>Blatant lies, even the base game constantly did that.
    
    25 hours to beat this seems rushed
    
    Spider-Man Miles Morales and Cyberpunk&#39;s Phabtim liberty DLC&#39;s are the greatest! Are you sure this is a great DLC as well???
    
    Ppl are funny, crying its too hard, these people have never played a DS DLC... They are always brutal, they have to be... Elden Ring was by far the easiest souls game so this has probably shocked ppl. Also you shouldn&#39;t forget it needs to take you back to when you first started Elden Ring as well
    
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2tj-b3DfmI&amp;t=460">7:40</a>-<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2tj-b3DfmI&amp;t=512">8:32</a> Regarding exploration possibilities in the Shadowlands
    
    Graphics looks better.
    
    The main game was borderlining on impossible and was almost unplayable. This DLC is worse yet! A DLC that is too hard is not even fun. Only a psycho would get enjoyment from dying over &amp; over thousands of times. That is not fun, it&#39;s just pure frustration. Not worth playing. Time to get a REFUND!
    
    10??? For what??? For messed up story telling, unbalanced map and tears bringing sadness???
    
    Couldn&#39;t even give people a special transition or scene when you first enter the DLC zone, just a Black loading screen lol.
<br>
<br>Mindless hype for more of the same (beyond new weapons) to include more vague story telling. 
<br>
<br>If it sells it sells, shrugs in capitalism.
    
    why my bum itchy
    
    boring... fromsoft died at DS2~
    
    Eldin Ring can do no wrong.
    
    This video literally just regurgitates everything that was in the previews.
    
    10/10 And this is the best 1st day purchases from a person who follow a never pre order rule.
    
    Wait. What IGN are still here?
    
    You know its a goat game when its dlc is also 10/10 !
    
    Its not a DLC anymore its basically Elden Ring 2
    
    IGN pretending to be honest ?
    
    Bro this isnt even a review, more like a tutorial with hella spoilers.
    
    Reviewer runs a bleed build.<br>You&#39;re welcome.
    
    Yes of course the new DLC weapons aren&#39;t as powerful as the base game if you use a broken build (dual wield jumping bleed in the video). <br><br>The weapons are balanced as long as you aren&#39;t using a broken build.
    
    Shadow of the Eyrdtree
    
    im listening but not watching the video. didnt want to spoil my gameplay. out for holidays cant wait to play when üòÖ get back. but ibaaw the first few seconds and there seem to be a lot of fire!  hhmm
    
    surface pro 10:  what does a certified check look like?
    
    What a time to be alive

    Waiting for quantum tv review for this dlc
    
    This review can literally start at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2tj-b3DfmI&amp;t=558">09:18</a> üòÖ
    
    And here is me who cannot defeat first knight in the game...üòÖ
    
    And people say this is Game Of The Year? LOL Probably the same people saying The Acolyte is brilliant.<br><br>(SPOILERS BELOW)<br><br>Like the base game, the DLC is visually beautiful. Also like the base game, the DLC is highly repetitive and highly boring.<br><br>The only attractive thing about Elden Ring is the mythology, cryptic though it is. The hours and hours of schlepping around doing repetitive tasks to get tiny morsels of storyline is ridiculous. And it&#39;s the storyline and lore to be discovered which makes the DLC attractive. <br><br>What a disappointment.<br><br>Miquella this. Miquella that. Miquella, Miquella,  Miquella. Both in the base game and the DLC, it&#39;s all you ever hear about. And what happens when you meet <b>finally</b> Miquella The Kind? The one Empyrean who apparently appears kind hearted and can see though the folly of Marika and the Erdtree and promises to make the world a better place? That&#39;s right, we have to lay waste to everything. Why? Because a little voice said so when we got high on poison. And we&#39;re given zero choice in the matter.<br><br>We see Miquella for the first time after being teased for 8 hours straight only to smoke him instantly with near zero explanation. We barely see the guy, talk to him, or really have our curiosity satisfied. Or make any choices for that matter. It&#39;s just The Elden Lord traipsing through another land to embody The Murder Hobo Express. And after all that mindless killing, what about the ending? Well there isn&#39;t one, so thanks for playing. A complete and utter anticlimax. You don&#39;t make anything better. Or worse. It was just a 8 hour killing spree for nothing.<br><br>The people who made this game are obviously fans of The Force Awakens: a two hour tease-of-a-movie to show us Luke Skywalker in the last 60 seconds and then drop the curtain with no explanation. What a joke.
    
    In my opinion, the Elden Ring is an 8/10, so is the DLC.

    Lenward, I love it you absolutely deserve that box. The mad lad, love to call you big floppa
    The perfect DLC dont exist.... <br><br>- THE DLC: -
    the dlc doesn&#39;t work and I payed 40 f*cking dollars
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FSJvdMy5Tg&amp;t=29">0:29</a> if only people seen the beauty of this dlc instead of ‚Äúi ran straight to rellana and got my shit kicked in because i had no upgrades. From suck‚Äù
    Dodge-roll spam, attack, repeat. So bland and boring at this point.
    @fightincowboy time stamp 503 that hammer I got first try at church of consolidation üòÖ
    Games like this don‚Äòt deserve a rapid fire review but a standard full review‚Ä¶
    why is not dense enought ? how has the dlc an arcane requirement?
    &quot;My next build-defining item could be in that red area down there.&quot;<br><br>Narrator: it wasn&#39;t
    I still say you should play the games that are the Genesis of from software kings field and the Armored Core games since those games over time is what built the reputation from software is known for
    

# Deployment in Production<a class="anchor" id="fifth-bullet"></a>
In order to deploy this solution to production, we choose to create a simple Streamlit application, containing a form to input the search subject, then the amount of videos to be searched, and a button to confirm the operation, which will trigger the code and output the final summary and the wordcloud.

The Streamlit app was deployed using Streamlit Community Cloud.

# Results and Future Improvements<a class="anchor" id="sixth-bullet"></a>
- For its first version the app functions well and is capable of providing very detailed answers, even when using an older model from OpenAI
- Some improvements that could be made include letting the user choose between other models available, adding an option to add or remove videos to the list before they are analysed, and tuning some parameters from the LLM in order to make it more or less creative with the answers.
- A smart language detector could also be implemented, so all videos from the same language would be redirected to different pre-processing pipelines.
